Surf’s Up: No Bad Time in Hawaii 

Overview and Purpose
Our analytical purpose was to provide our colleague W. Avywith analytics about temperature trends on the Island of Oahu. Specifically, W. Avy is interested in assessing the feasibility of a surf shop-ice cream joint venture. We were tasked with looking at temperature trends for the months of June and December on the island of Oahu. Using our knowledge of SQL Alchemy queries, and filtering, we provided the requested data. 

Analysis
1. We have a wealth of data to base our conclusions; for the month of December we have over 1,517 observed temperatures and for June we have an even 1,700. 
2. For both June and December we have high median temperatures (74, and 71 respectively). This strongly suggests that the weather is warm enough year round to sustain the venture. 
3. We have low standard deviations for both June and December (around 3 for both months), suggesting that there is little temperature variation on the island. 

Summary
In summary, there doesn’t seem to be a bad time in Hawaii to buy a surfboard and get ice cream at the same time. Both summer and winter months have high average temperatures and appear to be stable. Additional data could be collected by querying more than 2 months; perhaps by looking at each month individually we would find that there are concerning weather anomalies. Additionally, we should at the bare minimum be querying and incorporating precipitation data into our analysis as precipitation would likely affect the feasibility of the shop.
